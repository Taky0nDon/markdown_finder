# markdown_finder

This program walks through my 100 Days of Code folder, finds my readme files, sorts them in chronological order (by lesson day), and outputs a list of markdown links to the readme files.
I am trying to start using obsidian, and this seemed like a great opportunity to reduce the tedium in my life as I create a directory of my progress on 100 Days of Code.

Very much still a work in progress.
